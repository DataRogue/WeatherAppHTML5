<!-- Author's Note:

Holy crap, this has been a trying project. Going from a completely strict programming environment,
to no compiler, no syntax check, and no debugger, was quite challenging. Especially with the outdated
YQL documentaion. Regardless, I ended up making this app the best that I could and demonstrated several
different methods to accomplish each individual task. Also, I was only able to debug this my browser
so while everything works in theory, I have no actual way to testing: changes in geolocation and actual mobile display.

Also I made a bunch of vector graphics to use with the weather function, but dynamically resizing them has been a bit of a
pain I honestly don't feel like debugging it until I get familiar with that new Windows Web IDE. 

Overall this app does the following in no particular order:
Loads recent locations
Gets weather
Gets news
Gets time
Gets location
Error checks
Has several degrees of accuracy
Changes the amount of content displayed based on orientation
Looks pretty with Microsoft approved pallete. 
Has a responsive design
Likes to randomly fail it's geolocation calls on certain machines for absolutely no good reason, but work perfectly fine on others.
